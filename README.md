# Cool-note-taker

For this assignmnent, we had a starter code to build on and add extra files so the app could function properly. The user will be taken into the homepage of the app where they will click on the get started button which will take them to the notes.html file. Once there, the user will be able to add notes and delete previous ones.

Kindly find attached a screenshot of the app. You can the app through localhost:8080
I have issues with deploying it from heroku and for some reason its not working from github
